Todo List
Ah, the todo list! A ubiquitous project for any respectable JavaScript framework. Your job is to create a small React application to store and modify a list of tasks. Each task will have a text string as well as a completed property, which will be set to false initially. As you check off items, they should appear slashed out on the page. Using what you know about state and iterating through lists, render a list of items, and give the user the option to remove each item and add new ones. There are different ways to implement the remove function. One way to do it is using the built-in filter method. Filter returns a new array when invoked and is a great way to stay true to the functional nature of React.

Hint: When calling setState, make sure to send in a brand new object or array.

 Iterate through the existing tasks using the map method.
 Allow the user to add a new task, initially set to not completed.
 Allow the user to remove a task by clicking the delete button.
 Allow the user to toggle a task's completion property by clicking the checkbox next to it.
 Ninja Bonus: When updating the tasks' state, don't mutate the current task objects or the current task list.
 Sensei Bonus: Persist the todos list on page refreshes. Hint, consider combining the browser's localStorage with the useEffect hook.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
